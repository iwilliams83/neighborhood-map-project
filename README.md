This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project
This is a simple application that shows a particular neighborhood, and a list of 30 food spots in that neighborhood. Users can filter the locations, and see the list change, as well as the map markers disappear (or re-appear) in real time.

## Technical Notes
The app is written in React, and utilizes the Google Maps API (for the map, markers, and info windows), and the Foursquare API (for the food spot locations).

## How to get started
 - Fork and clone the repo
 - run `npm install` and `npm start`
 - alternatively you can run `yarn install` and `yarn start`
